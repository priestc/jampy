# Takeloom

A CLI application for musicians to record instruments over backing tracks, manage songs/albums, and track completed takes.

Takeloom handles continuous audio recording, playback mixing, session logging, and per-take file management. Record one instrument at a time — each new session plays back your previous takes alongside the backing track so you can layer parts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PortAudio, libsndfile, ffmpeg (system libraries)
- yt-dlp (optional, system binary) — only needed to add YouTube URLs as backing tracks from the New Project dialog

See [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md) for install instructions for each operating system.

## Install

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/priestc/takeloom.git
```

## Usage

### Studio Setup

Configure your studio in three steps. Each command reads and updates `~/studio_config.json` independently, so you can re-run one without redoing the others.

```bash
takeloom setup-studio              # studio name, location, musician, backup server
takeloom setup-recording-devices   # sample rate, buffer size, output device, input labels, camera
takeloom setup-instruments         # assign instruments to input channels
```

`setup-recording-devices` also lets you pick a camera. If one is configured, every session
records video alongside the audio (see [Recording Session](#recording-session)).

`setup-studio` also configures the **Studio Session Vault** — shared storage for everything
a project used to keep to itself: recorded sessions, backing tracks, and completed takes
(see [Project Structure](#project-structure)). A project is just a setlist file now. Three
vault modes: local only (default, under `~/Documents`), remote only (pushed to the backup
server and removed locally once that's verified), or both (pushed but also kept locally).
Starting a session downloads whatever that project's setlist needs from the remote first,
in remote-only mode. If you have projects from before the vault existed, run
`takeloom migrate-sessions-to-vault` once to move everything in — safe to re-run,
already-migrated projects are skipped.

### Graphical Interface

```bash
takeloom ui
```

Opens a desktop window (built with tkinter). Currently implements the Studio Setup screen —
the same fields as `takeloom setup-studio` — with more screens to follow.

### Creating a Project

```bash
takeloom new-project
```

Enter a project name (e.g. "My Album"). Creates `~/Takeloom Projects/My Album.json` — an
empty setlist.

### Updating the Setlist

Copy audio files (FLAC, WAV, MP3, M4A) into the vault's `backing_tracks/` directory, then:

```bash
takeloom update-setlist "My Album"
```

Adds any of the vault's backing tracks not yet in this project's setlist (omit the project
name to use the last-used project). Each track in the setlist includes a `volume` field
(default 100%) that you can edit manually to adjust backing track playback level.

### Recording Session

```bash
takeloom start-session guitar "My Album"
```

The session plays the backing track through your speakers, monitors your instrument input in real-time, and records your take. Controls:

| Key | Action | When |
|-----|--------|------|
| `r` | Start recording (plays backing track) | Waiting |
| `b` | Back to start (restart the take) | Playing |
| `e` | Mark song end (complete the take) | Playing |
| `n` | Move to next track (auto-starts recording) | Between tracks |
| `l` | Lower backing track volume by 5% | Any time |
| `u` | Raise backing track volume by 5% | Any time |
| `q` | End session | Any time |

**Completing a take:** Press `r` to start, then `e` when the song finishes. The take is saved to the vault's `completed_takes/` and set as the preferred take in the setlist.

**Restarting a take:** Press `b` to loop back to the beginning. The backing track restarts and a new take file begins.

**Volume adjustments** are saved back to the setlist file at the end of the session.

**Video:** if a camera is configured (`takeloom setup-recording-devices`), the whole session is
also recorded on video, saved as `session_video.mp4` alongside `session.flac` once the session
ends. The video has two audio tracks: a compressed (AAC) mix of the backing track + your
instrument for easy playback, and a lossless (FLAC) track of just your instrument alone.

### Multi-Instrument Layering

Start a new session with a different instrument (e.g. "bass"). The backing track plays mixed with your previously recorded preferred takes, so you hear everything together while recording the new part.

### Desktop Audio Capture

To record virtual instruments, software synths, or system audio, you need a virtual audio loopback device. See [Desktop Audio Capture Setup](docs/desktop-audio-capture.md) for instructions.

### Live Streaming

The GUI's Streaming tab can push every session live to YouTube over RTMP — just paste a
stream key from YouTube Studio and enable it. Connecting a YouTube account is optional
and only needed if you also want each session's stream auto-titled with the studio,
musician, project, and date; that requires creating your own free Google Cloud OAuth
credentials. See [YouTube Streaming Setup](docs/youtube-streaming-setup.md) for the
steps, and why it can't just be a one-click sign-in.

## Project Structure

A project is just a setlist file — `<projects_dir>/My Album.json`. Everything else lives in
the shared Studio Session Vault (see [Studio Setup](#studio-setup)) instead of belonging to
one project, so two different projects can reference the same backing track or completed
take (most commonly a song pulled in from the Inspiration library — see
[Cross-Project Take Reuse](#cross-project-take-reuse)) without either downloading or
recording it twice:

```
<projects_dir>/
├── My Album.json
└── Side Project.json

<vault>/
├── backing_tracks/
│   ├── song1.mp3
│   └── a1b2c3d4_song2.flac
├── completed_takes/
│   ├── song1 - guitar - take1 [upload:a1b2c3d4].flac
│   ├── song1 - bass - take1 [upload:a1b2c3d4].flac
│   └── song2 - guitar - take2 [youtube:dQw4w9WgXcQ].flac
├── inspiration_takes.json
└── sessions/
    └── 2025-01-15_14-30-00_guitar_My Album/
        ├── session.flac
        ├── session_video.mp4
        └── session_log.json
```

- `backing_tracks/` and `completed_takes/` are shared across every project. A locally
  uploaded file gets a short random prefix added only if its plain name would otherwise
  collide with an unrelated project's file; a file that already has a globally unique name
  (a YouTube download, or one pulled from the Inspiration library) keeps it as-is.
- A completed take's filename tags the exact backing track it was recorded against —
  `[upload:<id>]`, `[youtube:<video id>]`, or `[inspiration:<track id>]` — since backing
  tracks are shared vault-wide now and two entries can share a display name while pointing
  at different audio.
- Existing take files are never deleted. New takes increment the take number and replace the preferred take in the setlist.
- `inspiration_takes.json` — the cross-project take index (see below).
- `session.flac` — the continuous raw recording spanning the full session
- `session_log.json` — musician, studio, and event data; what post-session processing replays to find completed takes and copy them into the vault's `completed_takes/`
- `session_video.mp4` is only present when a camera is configured

### Cross-Project Take Reuse

A song pulled from the Inspiration library carries a stable ID from that library, so a take
recorded on it from *any* project is recorded into `inspiration_takes.json` too, keyed by
that ID. This is what lets an "inspiration filter" setlist slot (a standing "draw a random
song from this filter each session" entry — added from the GUI's Streaming/Setlist screens)
prefer redrawing a song other instruments already have a take on, and what lets
`ensure_setlist_files_local` (session start, in remote vault mode) pull down another
project's take on a shared song before it's needed.
